# deep-zertz

Modify main.py in order to specify the rules and board size for Zertz and to change between training, AI vs AI evaluation, and Human vs AI evaluation.

Modify config.py in order to specify the model parameters and where to find the checkpoint files (required for evaluation). Ensure that the neural network parameters specified in config.py match those that were used to generate the training checkpoint files loaded in main.py.
